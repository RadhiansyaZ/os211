# Top 10 List of Week 02
1. [Public Key Cryptography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSIDS_lvRv4&list=PL0LZxT9Dgnxfu1ILW0XnLnq3mb0L5mUPr)<br>
A very gentle introduction to public-private key cryptography from Computerphile. You'll get the coolness and the basic concept about symmetric-asymmetric encryption works.

2. [Hashing Algorithms and Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg)<br>
Back again with the Computerphile and our favorite content creator, Tom Scott explaining the basics of hashing algorithm (like md5 and SHA) in a friendly way.

3. [SHA: Secure Hashing Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY&list=PL0LZxT9Dgnxfu1ILW0XnLnq3mb0L5mUPr&index=2)<br>
We'll using SHA256 encyption starting from this week. Why we don't learn the basics?.

4. [Prime Numbers & RSA Encryption Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JD72Ry60eP4)<br>
RSA are using a large prime numbers, isn't it interesting to know more about RSA?.

5. [Comparison of Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography with Existing Vulnerabilities and Countermeasures](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267411519_Comparison_of_Symmetric_and_Asymmetric_Cryptography_with_Existing_Vulnerabilities_and_Countermeasures)<br>
A short article about the sym and asym cryptography along with performance analysis and it's vulnerabilities.

6. [What are Digital Signatures?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s22eJ1eVLTU)<br>
Besides Udacity, here is a quick Youtube video about Digital Signature and it's relation to public key.

7. [Belajar Memakai GNU Privacy Guard (GnuPG/GPG)](https://medium.com/kode-dan-kodean/belajar-memakai-gnu-privacy-guard-gnupg-gpg-3944e19dba91)<br>
This is just a simple and should be easy to understadn GnuPG tutorial in Indonesian :D.

8. [periksadata.com](https://periksadata.com/)<br>
Data breaches could be a threat to our password, data, or even our identity. Teguh Aprianto a.k.a. @secgron and his fellow colleague create an Indonesian data breaches checker whether our data have been compromised using our email.

9. [TED Talk:In the war for information, will quantum computers defeat cryptographers?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3BJVaioX_k)<br>
Cryptography and encryption is a vital subject in this war of information. This talk will give a broaden view of what's coming.

10. [Shor's Algorithm Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lvTqbM5Dq4Q)<br>
Did we think our 256bit encryption is secure enough? Well, minutephysics tell us about an algorithm that can destroy even a 256bit encryption (well, we need a quantum computer for that too).
