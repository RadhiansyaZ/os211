# Top 10 List of Week 03
1. [What Is a File System, Why Are There So Many of Them?](https://www.howtogeek.com/196051/htg-explains-what-is-a-file-system-and-why-are-there-so-many-of-them/)<br>
This article is like a File System 101 because it tells us why different operating system can have different file system. Also, it gives us a brief overview on some commonly used file systems.

2. [Explaining File Systems: NTFS, exFAT, FAT32, ext4 & More](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_h30HBYxtws)<br>
If you are too lazy to read an article above, here are the comparison between popular all popular file systems.

3. [How to mount and use an exFAT drive on linux](https://www.howtogeek.com/235655/how-to-mount-and-use-an-exfat-drive-on-linux/)<br>
Some people including me are no longer using FAT32 format for flash drives because of the 4GB file limitation. So, I use exFAT, a FAT32 without those problem. However, to mount it in linux, you need to install a few packages.

4. [NFS (Netwoek File System)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/network-file-system-nfs/)<br>
Of course this isn't NFS for Need For Speed. By the way, this article written by GeeksForGeeks is really good at explaining NFS into something that can be easily understood by dummies :D.

5. [How to Share Your Computers Files With a Virtual Machine](https://www.howtogeek.com/189974/how-to-share-your-computers-files-with-a-virtual-machine/)<br>
Sometimes we need to take files from host to the guest machine, but by default guest doesn't have access to host. So, we need to set up a shared folder(s).

6. [An introduction to Linux's EXT4 filesystem](https://opensource.com/article/17/5/introduction-ext4-filesystem)<br>
A must read article from opensource.com, all about the ext4 filesystem used by majority of Linux users.

7. [Why are swap partitions discouraged on SSD drives, are they harmful?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/652337/why-are-swap-partitions-discouraged-on-ssd-drives-are-they-harmful#:~:text=Early%20SSDs%20had%20a%20reputation,use%20an%20SSD%20for%20swap.&text=Placing%20swap%20on%20an%20SSD%20will%20result%20in%20better%20performance,due%20to%20its%20faster%20speeds.)<br>
At the beginning of the Operating System Course and if we followed tutorial correctly, we created a swap partitions along with the Debian installation on the VBox. Some of us are especially who have a modern devices are using a device with SSD installed, this Q&A Threads should be an answer to our earlier question "are they harmful?".

8. [Why Deleted Files Can Be Recovered, and How You Can Prevent It](https://www.howtogeek.com/125521/htg-explains-why-deleted-files-can-be-recovered-and-how-you-can-prevent-it/)<br>
Deleted files aren't actually deleted physically in a first place. It's just delete pointer to that files in a physical drive until new files come to replace it, more explanation on the article.

9. [What is a TAR file?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Euub2EAt8jQ)<br>
This video explains and demonstrate TAR file and in this week we use this format as one of our assignment. In a nutshell, TAR is a archive just like ZIP and RAR but you can watch the video for the complete information about how TAR differentiate from other archive :).

10. [Virtual Filesystem in Linux](https://opensource.com/article/19/3/virtual-filesystems-linux)<br>
VFS (Virtual Filesystem) underlies the famous observation that in Unix-like systems "everything is a file.". This article should give enough abstraction for us to learn more about it :D.
